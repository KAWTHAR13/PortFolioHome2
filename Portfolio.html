                Llamas are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small amount of lanolin.
                [2] Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight
                 for 8 to 13 km.

            called Tylopoda, or "bump-footed", from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet.

            Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia (/Àå√¶n…™Ààme…™li…ô/[4]). 
        With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, 
        and grow from a hollow sphere of cells.

            Designers craft the look and feel of a product, while developers code it. But they still have to work in 
            tandem to create a well-designed final product. That's why the better collaboration between designers 
            and developers is established, the better outcome from the design process will be.

    <div class="divchild3"> <h2>Wildlife</h2>
        <p>  <br>
            Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live
             wild in an area without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals
              that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas including 
            the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. A November 2008 report from biologist and author 
            Sally Kneidel, PhD, documented numerous wildlife species for sale in informal markets along the Amazon River, including wild-caught
             marmosets sold for as little as $1.60 (5 Peruvian soles).[13][self-published source?] Many Amazon species, including peccaries, agoutis, 
            turtles, turtle eggs, anacondas, armadillos are sold primarily as food.
